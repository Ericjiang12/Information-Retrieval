Some notes for the project

1. When building index, we ignore the urls that contains "Badcontent" and "ironwood". This is because we notice
that we couldn't open url with this pattern, and we do not want our users to get those useless links in search results.

2. We put extra weight to the docs when terms appear in the title or header of the doc.
